Description: Iterator for generating permutations and combinations. They
    can be either drawn with or without replacement, or with distinct/ non-distinct 
    items (multiset). The generated sequences are in lexicographical order 
    (dictionary order). The algorithms to generate permutations and combinations are 
    memory efficient. These iterative algorithms enable users to process all sequences 
    without putting all results in the memory at the same time. 
    The algorithms are written in C/C++ for faster performance.
