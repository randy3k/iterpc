Description: A collection of iterators for generating permutations and combinations with or
    without replacement; with distinct items or non-distinct items (multiset).
    The generated sequences are in lexicographical order (dictionary order). The
    algorithms to generate permutations and combinations are memory efficient. These
    iterative algorithms enable users to process all sequences without putting all
    results in the memory at the same time. The algorithms are written in C/C++ for
    faster performances.
